# Privacy Policy

In short: We collect as little information as possible from you, and we do not share or sell your information with any other company or entity.

## What Is Collected

The information that may be collected when you use this service includes:

- Login credentials (the email and password you signed up with)

## What Isn't Collected

Anything that isn't explicitly stated above is not collected or stored. Some information, like your User agent and IP address, may be automatically sent to our servers when you make a connection to our platform over the internet. This happens with all website and internet services you visit.

Because this information could be used to identify you, we do not log (store) it at all. This is unusual, but we believe it's very important in protecting your privacy.

## What Is Shared

We don't share any collected information with any other outside entity, company, or individual. 

Like any other company, we will comply with court ordered requests for information when we are legally required to do so. However, we have very little information to provide in terms of these legal requests as we try to collect as little as possible in the first place.

## Updates

If we update this security policy, we will keep a log on this page of the change history. The privacy policy will be kept in a public git repository (https://github.com/logicbite/privacy-policy), so every change will be viewable in a diff-like format.

## Hat Tips

Our privacy policy was influenced by DuckDuckGo's privacy policy.
